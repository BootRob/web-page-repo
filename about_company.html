    <h1> About Us</h1>

    <P> A contract manufacturing (CM) Company that manufactures electronic curcuit boards for large OEMs . The OEMs design the hardware and circuits, and the CMs build the boards using the designs provided. The CMs use state of the art manufacturing assembly techniques which include automated assembly lines where machines place the parts on the pre-printed circuit boards, send them through t=ovens where the parts are loldered to the boards, and wash the boards after they are soldered. The process involves setups of the placement machines for each board; programming the prociles of the "ovens" so the temperature are appropriate for the boards. blah blah blah</P>
